#### Sample Description

This sample is a showcase covering:
- the usage of an embedded Jetty
- in a standalone Java application
- with resources reloading (for a nice development experience)

It is a very lightweight approach, as the only dependencies are:
- Jetty
   - a speedy and rich Web container
- RestEasy
   - a nice and up to date JAX-RS implementation
