Standard Jetty startup options
------------------------------

In this case:
- Jetty is started as a normal application server
- your application is a regular web app hosted by Jetty

mvn -Djetty.reload=automatic -Djetty.scanIntervalSeconds=2 jetty:run

If you are depending on Eclipse, ensure you have Project -> Build Automatically enabled so that the classes are recompiled.
